This is an exact copy of TheKyle's version, but with chords above the lines.
After a few drinks, I got really confused with the chords below the lines. This helps :D
Good song, and good tab by TheKyle.

w/Capo on 2nd Fret:


     Fsus2      C
It's not
         Fsus2       C
What you thought
     Am          F         C
When you first began       it
    Fsus2      C
You got
          Fsus2      C
What you  want
    Am                        F
Now you can hardly stand it though,
   D7
By now you know
     Fsus2       D7      F      D
It's not      going to stop
     Fsus2       D7      F      D
It's not      going to stop
     C     G      Bb       F
It's not going to stop
              Fsus2      C
'Til you wise up


       Fsus2      C
You're sure
          Fsus2       C
There's a cure
    Am               F        C
And you have finally found    it
    Fsus2      C
You think
    Fsus2      C
One drink
     Am                     F
Will shrink you 'til you're underground
    D7
And living down
         Fsus2      D7     F      D
But it's not      going to stop
     Fsus2      D7     F      D
It's not      going to stop
     C     G      Bb      F
It's not going to stop
              Fsus2      C
'Til you wise up


   F
Prepare a list of what you need
  D7
Before you sign away the deed
            Fsus2        D7    F      D
'Cause it's not       going to stop
     Fsus2      D7     F      D
It's not      going to stop
     C     G      Bb
It's not going to stop
     F           C
'Til you wise up
         G            Bb
No, it's not going to stop
     F                   C
'Til you wise up
         G            Bb     F
No, it's not going to stop
                      Fsus2   C
So just...give up
                      Fsus2   C...
