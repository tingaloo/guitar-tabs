Capo 7

Em  C  G (2x)


[Verse]

C                 Am             G
You kept all the things I threw away.
C                  Am              G
A leaf I picked, a birthday card I made
C                         Am                          
Holding on to memories of you and me
                         Em      D
We didn't last a year, well
C (once)                   Am (once)
We're just a box of souvenirs, 'cause


[Chorus]

Em    C  G                     Em
Maybe, I pulled the panic cord
      C  G                       Em
And maybe, you were happy, I was bored
        C             G
Maybe I wanted you to change
Em      C           G
Maybe I'm the one to blame


[Verse]

C                  Am                 G
This meant more to you than it did to me.
C             Am                 G
I was full of doubts and you believed.
C                                 Am                       
The more that you keep coming over
Em      D
The more I know it's over, dear, oh

C (once)                   Am (once)
We're just a box of souvenirs, and


[Chorus]

Em    C  G                     Em
Maybe, I pulled the panic cord
      C  G                       Em
And maybe, you were happy, I was bored
        C             G
Maybe I wanted you to change
Em      C           G
Maybe I'm the one to blame
  
[ Post-Chorus ]
Em    C  G                            Em
Maybe, you were just too nice to me
    C  G                             Em
And maybe, it took me way too long to leave
        C              G
Maybe once we felt the same
Em      C           G
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Em      C           G
Maybe I'm the one to blame


[Bridge]
(for the bridge, keep playing a G on the high e string at all times)

D           Em
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
C
That's the way the story go-oes  (2x)


[Chorus]
(Strum each chord once for the first half of the chorus)

Em    C  G                     Em
Maybe, I pulled the panic cord
      C  G                       Em
And maybe, you were happy, I was bored
        C             G
Maybe I wanted you to change
Em      C           G
Maybe I'm the one to blame, oh


[Post-Chorus]

(begin normal strumming again)

Em    C  G                            Em
Maybe, you were just too nice to me
    C  G                             Em
And maybe, it took me way too long to leave
        C              G
Maybe once we felt the same
Em      C           G
  Maybe I'm the one to blame
Em      C           G
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Em      C           G (once)
Maybe I'm the one to blame


[Outro]
Oh, maybe I'm the one to blame
